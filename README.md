# Sign-to-Speech
  
Sign-to-Speech is done in two steps.  
1. Sign-to-Text.  
2. Text-to-Speech.  
  
For the first part, American Sign Language(ASL), most commonly used sign language is used. Two types of ASL Datasets are used.  
Dataset-1 : ASL Dataset without bounding boxes.  
Dataset-2 : ASL Dataset with bounding boxes.  
Trained various SOTA models, custom CNN models on the above datasets and compared their results. 

  
For the second part, one of the top performing sileros TTS models at the time has been used for the Speech Recognition from the Text, produced from above.
